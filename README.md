# mi101-colab

Emergency repo of Google colab-compatible workshop notebooks!

This is offered as a resource if you are *unable* to get a local installation of Python + the required packages working.

## Instructions

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click on the `GitHub` tab (see image below)
3. Enter the URL for this repo: `https://github.com/zdelrosario/mi101-colab` in the search bar
4. Open the notebook you want to work on; the first code chunk will install the packages needed for the notebook
