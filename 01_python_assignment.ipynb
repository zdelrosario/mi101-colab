    "## Highest-level View\n",
    "Throughout this day of the workshop, we will be writing computer software. Before diving into the details, it is beneficial to understand what tools we'll be using, and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "Python is a [*programming language*](https://www.python.org), and an extremely popular one at that. Python is praised for its readability, is consistently ranked as a top programming language, and is used by both top [software companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Uses) and scientists doing computation. All of this is to say that knowing how to write Python code is a valuable skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter\n",
    "Jupyter is a [*programming environment*](https://jupyter.org), often used for writing and sharing Python code. Just as one could choose to write English on stone tablets or on paper, one could choose to write Python code in simple files or in *jupyter notebooks*. These notebooks are useful for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multimedia: This document you're reading now is a jupyter notebook -- it is a combination of (executable) Python code and (formatted) plain text. By allowing the juxtaposition of different media (code and natural language, to name a couple options), one can provide human-readable context next to executable software.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Saves state: Jupyter notebooks *save state*, allowing you to run some code, save the results, close the document and come back to it later. This is certainly possible in other coding environments, but jupyter has built-in facilities to make this easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reproducible: [Reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) is a critical issue in science -- results cannot be considered scientifically valid unless they can be reproduced under similar conditions. The same principles apply to computational experiments; all too often software is written under time pressure, resulting in scattered documentation and analysis. Consolidating documentation and analysis within a single notebook facilitates scientific reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are not *always* the best media for writing code; for instance, python *packages* are not written in jupyter notebooks. However, for our purposes, jupyter is a good solution."

    "This jupyter notebook is an *interactive exercise* -- it contains some reading, but the focus is on fill-in-the-blank sections that are meant to test your understanding and spark further learning. Pedagogy research shows that so-called *active learning* -- learning by doing -- is far more effective than lecture alone. Thus, you will get the most out of this workshop if you do the work! Try -- to the best of your ability -- to complete the exercises in these notebooks, and please feel free to ask the TA's questions if you get stuck. (It's what we're here for.)\n",
